        question: "What and Why of Term Insurance?",

            `<p>Term insurance is a risk management tool. Before we address risk management tool in detail, let me give you an example of risk management. After explaining risk management, I will further explain what term insurance is, and then ‘what’ and ‘why’ of purchasing a term insurance is.</p><br>

<p>I assume that most of you reading this article must be having a car or bike to travel to workplace or for day-to-day commutation. Let me ask you, what is the first action you take when you purchase a car or bike (other than registering your car, paying road tax, driving license etc.)?</p><br>

<p>The answer is that, you purchase an insurance policy. And why do you purchase an insurance policy for your car or bike? First, it is to cover for any damages in case of an accident. Second, because it is compulsory i.e., compulsion regulated by the government (only third-party insurance is compulsory).</p><br>

<p>What do you get in return? You get peace of mind because of three reasons –</p><br>

<p>1. The expenses of repairing the vehicle are covered by the insurance company in case of any damage caused by an accident.</p>
<p>2. Any third-party damage caused by your vehicle is covered by the insurance company.</p>
<p>3. You do not have to run away when you see a policeman on the road checking documents. (Trust me, few of the vehicle owners purchase vehicle insurance only because of this reason 😊)</p><br>
<p>What will happen if you do not purchase a vehicle insurance policy? You will have the risk of paying damages from your own pocket if you run into an accident.</p><br>

<p>So, what are you basically doing when you are purchasing a vehicle insurance policy? The answer is, you are simply transferring the risk from yourself to the insurance company. The entire expenses would be paid by the insurance company in case of damages caused by the accident (though 100% claim is not paid by insurance company, this is just an example). You can call it risk transfer or risk management, but it for sure ensures peace of mind in case of any unfortunate event.</p><br>

<p>Now that you have understood the basic concept of risk management, let us see how this risk management tool works in our life.</p><br>

<strong>What is Term Insurance?</strong><br><br>
<p>Term Insurance is a risk management tool to cover the financial loss i.e., to cover your family’s financial needs if you are not around.</p><br>

<p>No one can replace the emotional loss of a family if any member of the family dies. It would be more difficult if it is the earning member of the family. But the family still need to survive financially.</p><br>

<p>If you have substantial assets (like FDs, mutual funds, real estate, bank balance etc), it would ease the family’s financial burden. But what if there are no financial assets. How do the family manage the same lifestyle? How do they manage to achieve the financial goals?</p><br>

<p>This is where Term Insurance comes into picture as a risk management tool i.e. to provide financial security to your family in your absence.</p><br>

<strong>How does term insurance work?</strong><br><br>
<p>The concept is very simple. You apply to purchase a life insurance policy called term insurance for a particular sum assured and a particular term. The annual premium is decided by the insurance company based on your age, sum assured, health conditions, habits, job etc. You pay the premium for the term of the policy. If you die in between, the insurance company will pay sum assured to your family. If you survive for the term of policy, you will not get anything back.</p><br>

<p>Insurance companies have invented different variants where premium is returned after policy term is over, which will be discussed in another article.</p><br>

<p>Before I give you an example of how Term Insurance works, let me define the basic terms;</p><br>

<p>Sum assured – Sum assured is the amount of money that the insurance company promises to pay to your family in case you die.</p><br>

<p>Premium – Premium is the amount of money; you promise to pay to insurance company for term insurance cover which is basically, the sum assured.</p><br>

<p>Term of policy – Term of policy is the time frame for which you promise to pay premium to the insurance company or insurance company promise to pay the sum assured. The term can be 5/10/15/20 or 40 years.</p><br>

<p>Still confused? Let me give you an example.</p><br>

<p>Ajay is 27 years old and decides to purchase a Term Insurance cover of 1 Crore. He applies to different insurance companies and gets the premium quote of 10,000 per year for sum assured of 1 Crore. Finally, he decides to purchase the term insurance cover from ABC Company for a term of 33 years which is, till his age is 60. The premium amount comes as 10,000 per year.</p><br>

<p>If between the age of 27 to 60, Ajay dies, the insurance company will pay the amount of 1 Crore to Ajay’s family. If Ajay survives beyond age 60, the insurance company will not pay anything and Ajay will not get his premium back. It is as simple as that.</p><br>

<p>This is what Term Insurance is.</p><br>

<strong>Now, why Term Insurance?</strong><br><br>
<p>Ajay is working in a multinational company and is earning well. He is the single earning member of the family. He is also very smart in investing his money. He is 27 years old, his spouse is 26 years old and they have a lovely son who is aged 2 years. Ajay’s parents are dependent on him. He has already started investing for his son’s higher education/marriage goal, retirement planning, home purchase and various other goals.</p><br>

<p>But one thing he never believed in was to purchase a term insurance cover. His term insurance cover requirement was around 2 Crores and the premium was around 20,000 per annum. Why to waste money on term insurance cover if I am not going to get anything back if I survive was his way of thinking. Would it not be better if I invest the same amount of money and get handsome returns?</p><br>

<p>Fast forward a year, Ajay met with an accident and died unfortunately (Sorry for being so blunt about using the word die everywhere, but I must be blunt here). He had an investment amount of around 30 Lakhs. Now, would this 30 Lakhs be enough for his family to survive?</p><br>

<p>The answer is No.</p><br>

<p>If the answer is no, what can be the possible scenarios for his family?</p><br>

<p>1. Would his family be able to maintain the same lifestyle?</p>
<p>2. Would his parents have to start working at old age?</p>
<p>3. Would his son’s goals be achieved?</p>
<p>4. Would they be able to purchase their dream house?</p><br>
<p>There can be thousand of questions here and the answer is none but, one- term insurance.</p><br>

<p>Again, no one can fill the emotional gap, but someone must fill in the financial gap and that is the reason why term insurance is here for us.</p><br>

<strong>Points to remember</strong><br><br>
<p>If you have enough assets, there is no need to purchase term insurance but if you don’t have any, purchase Term Insurance cover. The goals need to be fulfilled even if you are not around.</p><br>`,

        question: "Do You Need Term Insurance?",

            <p>In the last chapter, we read about what Term Insurance is and why you should purchase Term Insurance.</p><br>

<p>Does everyone need Term Insurance? The answer to this question is No. Everyone does not need Term Insurance. There are specific situations where a person needs Term Insurance, and these specific situations depend on 2 conditions;</p><br>

<p>1. Financial dependency</p>
<p>2. Total assets a person owns</p><br>

<p>These 2 factors go hand in hand when you decide if you need Term Insurance cover or not.</p><br>

<p>Let’s see how these 2 factors work in synchronization.</p><br>

<strong>Dependency and Total assets</strong><br><br>
<p>What is dependency –In simple terms, if a person is dependent on you for anything, it is called dependency. In financial terms, if a person is dependent on you for his/her financial needs, it is called financial dependency.</p><br>

<p>Now the question is – If a person is financially dependent on you, do you need Term Insurance in that case?</p><br>

<p>The answers can be both Yes or No.</p><br>

<p>Yes, you need a Term Insurance if you do not have the required assets i.e., the dependent person would not be able to achieve his/her financial goals from your existing assets, if you are not around.</p><br>

<p>No, you do not need Term Insurance if you have the required assets i.e. the dependent person would be able to achieve his/her financial goals from your existing assets, if you are not around.</p><br>

<strong>Let me clarify it with an example:</strong><br><br>
<p>Ajay has a Term Insurance requirement of 3 Crores which include his children’s higher education goals and his retirement goals (without calculating his assets like FDs, mutual funds, property, gold, stocks, etc.). But he has existing assets of around 6 Crores. Does Ajay need Term Insurance? The answer is No as he has more assets than Term Insurance cover requirement.</p><br>

<p>In the above example, would Ajay require Term Insurance if he has existing assets of 1 Crore. Yes, the Term Insurance requirement would be 2 Crores. In this case, his family would not be able to achieve their financial goals with existing assets if he is not around.</p><br>

<p>I hope the basic concept would be clear by now. Let us see the different life stages of a person and requirement of Term Insurance considering that you do not have required assets.</p><br>

<strong>Single with No Dependents</strong><br><br>
<p>Normally, this stage is at the beginning of your career i.e., when you start earning after your graduation or post-graduation. Do you need Term Insurance when you are single, and your parents are independent? The answer is -No.</p><br>

<strong>Single with Dependents</strong><br><br>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to purchase term insurance coverage in following cases.</p><br>

<p>1. When you are single and your parents are dependent on you.</p>

<p>2. When you are a single parent and your children are dependent on you.</p>

<p>3. Term insurance requirement will increase if you are a single parent and your parents are also dependent on you</p><br>

<strong>Married Couple (without children) – Single Income and Dual Income</strong><br><br>
<p>How does Term Insurance requirement change when you are married? First, you need to check who requires Term Insurance – you or your spouse?</p><br>

<p>If you are married and if there is only one breadwinner in the family, the person who is earning needs Term Insurance cover i.e., the spouse who is working need Term Insurance.</p><br>

<p>It is a common misconception that double-income married couples do not require any Term Insurance cover. In fact, both spouses need Term Insurance. The reason is simply the loss of income if any unfortunate event happens to one of the spouses.</p><br>

<p>In addition, if there are loans and if there is a substantial difference in income of the spouses, the necessity of Term Insurance increases.</p><br>

<p>What if one spouse die and the other spouse does not want to work after the unfortunate event or is not able to work due to disability?</p><br>

<p>So, it is always better to have term insurance coverage for both spouses and the cover amount should be divided in the ratio of their annual income.</p><br>

<strong>Married Couple with Dependent Parents</strong><br><br>
<p>Most of people see it from a single point of view; they consider their spouse as dependent when they purchase Term Insurance cover. What if your spouse and your parents, both are dependent on you? The need for Term Insurance is very high in this case. The amount of Term Insurance cover also increases as you need to consider the expenses of your parents as well as your spouse, if you are not around.</p><br>

<p>In this case, even if you have the required assets to achieve all your goals (as a couple)but do not have the required assets to support your parents, the spouse whose parents are dependent needs to purchase Term Insurance.</p><br>

<p>I am not trying to say that the other spouse will not take care of your parents, (if you are not around) but why would you make your parents dependent on your spouse? It would not cost much to add an additional layer of security.</p><br>

<strong>Married Couple with Children</strong><br><br>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to purchase term insurance coverage in this case.</p><br>

<p>If one of the spouses is earning, the breadwinner of the family needs to purchase Term Insurance.</p><br>

<p>If both spouses are earning, both need to take Term Insurance cover. If either of the spouses is planning to take a break from work, to take care of children, the spouse who is planning to work needs to take the higher cover.</p><br>

<strong>Retired</strong><br><br>
<p>Do retired people need to take Term Insurance cover? A plain simple answer is No. But it is slightly more complicated than that.</p><br>

<p>Normally, it is assumed that by the time you retire, your financial responsibilities would be over. It is not the case in every situation. Some exceptions can be there when you need Term Insurance cover even if you are retired.</p><br>

<p>Let me give you an example –Grandparents having responsibilities for their grandchildren (if some unfortunate event happens to parents).</p><br>

<p>Any outstanding loan, though you thought that it would be over by the time you retire but there is still some outstanding amount left, which may make a dent in the retired life of your spouse if something happens to you.</p><br>

<p>The premium of Term Insurance also increases drastically with age and there is no surety that you will get Term Insurance at this age.</p><br>

<p>So, this chapter was all about who needs Term Insurance and who does not. In next chapter, we will discuss how much Term Insurance cover you need.</p><br>

            <p>In my previous article, we learnt whether you need Term Insurance or not. If you have reached to the conclusion that you need Term Insurance, the next question is how much Term Insurance should you opt for? Is there any thumb rule that needs to be followed while purchasing Term Insurance cover? Should I purchase it based on my annual income OR Should I purchase it based on my annual expenses? Let’s address these questions one by one.</p><br>

<p>If you are looking for an answer in one sentence, my response would be –</p><br>

<p>Term Insurance = [Annual Income *20 + Liabilities (Loans)] – Assets (FDs, Mutual Funds, all properties excluding self-occupied home, and any other investments)</p><br>

<p>This will be the amount of term insurance cover that you will require.</p><br>

<strong>Is there any thumb rule to calculate Term Insurance cover requirement?</strong><br><br>
<p>I’m sure most of you must have seen advertisements on Facebook, Google, Instagram, print media, or on television about insurance companies promoting Term Insurance cover of 1 Crore. Does that mean is 1 Crore the benchmark for purchasing Term Insurance cover? The answer is No, it is not.</p><br>

<p>Let me explain to you why most life insurance companies often advertise cover of 1 Crore.</p><br>

<p>1. Crore is a huge psychological barrier for most middle-class families. It is very difficult to achieve this amount with savings and investments at an early stage of life (barring exceptions of high monthly income families) and with Term Insurance cover, it seems achievable at least for their families if they are not around.</p>
<p>2. The premium amount payable is comparatively lower for a term insurance cover of 1 Crore. For a young person aged 25-26, the premium payable may be lesser than 1,000 per month which seems very affordable. That is the reason why you might have seen insurance companies showing premiums in monthly mode and not in the yearly mode in most Term Insurance advertisements.</p>
<p>3. Individuals who are earning more than 40,000/50,000 per month are normally eligible for 1 Crore term insurance cover.</p><br>
<p>Remember, life insurance companies are targeting the masses with their advertisements. These companies can show insurance coverage of 2/3 Crores but for that, they need to do very target marketing i.e., high-income individuals. This is exactly the reason why most insurance companies show advertisements for 1 Crore Term Insurance cover, which is to cover the masses.</p><br>

<p>Coming back to the question, is there any thumb rule to calculate how much Term Insurance cover you should buy?</p><br>

<p>No, there is no thumb rule and it is entirely dependent on your income, expenditure, and your assets.</p><br>

<p>However, there is a thumb rule for insurance companies on how much insurance coverage they can provide to any individual, which I will explain later.</p><br>

<p>If there is no thumb rule, how do we calculate the requirement? Let’s see, how to calculate the insurance cover requirement.</p><br>

<strong>Human Life Value (HLV)</strong><br><br>
<p>Every human being has an unlimited earning potential. You may be starting your job with a monthly salary of 25,000 per month but 10 years down the lane, you may be earning 2.50 Lakhs per month or it may be 25 Lakhs per month. Ideally, there is no way to calculate Human Life Value (HLV) but still, it needs to drill down to a certain number to manage risk for the family, if any unfortunate event happens to the breadwinner of the family. That’s where the role of income replacement and expenses replacement methods comes into the picture to calculate the Term Insurance cover requirement of an individual.</p><br>

<p>There are 2 methods of calculating the insurance requirement for an individual:</p><br>

<p>1. Income replacement method</p>
<p>2. Expense replacement method</p><br>
<p>Let’s discuss these 2 methods one by one.</p><br>

<strong>1. Income replacement method</strong><br><br>
<p>There are 3 variables that are required to calculate insurance cover through the income replacement method –</p><br>

<p>1. Current Income</p>
<p>2. Current Age</p>
<p>3. Retirement Age</p><br>
<p>Let me give you an example here – Example 1</p><br>

<p>Ajay is 35 years old and is earning a salary of 1 Lakh per month. He wants to retire at the age of 60. What would be the insurance requirement for Ajay?</p><br>

<p>In this example, Ajay’s Annual income = 1 Lakh * 12 Months = 12 Lakhs Per annum</p><br>

<p>Gap between retirement age and current age = Retirement age – Current Age = 60 Years – 35 Year = 25 Years</p><br>

<p>Term Insurance cover required = Gap between retirement age and current age X Annual income i.e. 25*12 = 300 Lakhs = 3 Crores</p><br>

<p>This is a very simple method to calculate the requirement. But the question arises – what about any increments in salary?</p><br>

<p>Let us assume that there is an average increment of 6% in Ajay’s annual salary for the next 25 years. The total amount that Ajay would have received in next 20 years would be as follows:</p><br>`,
            `<br><p>The total amount Ajay would receive from his salary in the next 25 years would be 658 Lakhs. Now, we need to know how much amount one needs to deposit in debt instruments now (for the safer side) assuming an interest rate of 6% p.a. which would generate the same income year on year (as shown in the table). For this to happen, we need to calculate the present value (PV) of the cash flow which comes out to be 3 Crores which is same as the term insurance value calculated above.</p><br>

<p>The increment and additional returns from claim amount investments just complicate the overall process. The ideal way is to multiply your annual income by the number of years remaining for retirement. Additionally, I have not deducted any personal expenses of the breadwinner, which will not be required if some unfortunate event happens to the breadwinner (just to make calculations a bit simple).</p><br>

<p>The term insurance requirement will also decrease if you assume higher returns from the sum assured i.e. cover amount.</p><br>

<p>In next chapter, we will discuss expenses replacement method – with calculator</p><br>

<strong>Points to remember:</strong><br><br>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>There is no thumb rule for calculating the insurance coverage requirement for you. It is dependent on your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and goals.</li>
    <li>1 Crore coverage may be high or low cover based on your personal requirements. Do not just blindly purchase term insurance cover of 1 Crore. Remember not to go by the advertisements published by life insurance companies.</li>

        question: "How much term insurance do I need - Part 2",
        answer: "The basic difference between income and expense replacement methods is whether you take monthly income or monthly expenses for your term insurance cover requirement needs. In the case of monthly income, you take the difference between your retirement age and your current age while in the case of monthly expenses you take the life expectancy of the younger spouse.",

            `<p>In the last chapter, we learnt about income replacement method to calculate the term insurance cover requirement. In this chapter, we will learn about expense replacement method to calculate the term insurance cover requirement.</p><br>

<p>The basic difference between income and expense replacement methods is whether you take monthly income or monthly expenses for your term insurance cover requirement needs. In the case of monthly income, you take the difference between your retirement age and current age while in the case of monthly expenses you take the life expectancy of the younger spouse.</p><br>


<p>What is life expectancy – Life expectancy is the average period that a person may expect to live. It may be 70 years/80 years/ 90 years and for some, it may be 100 years.</p><br>


<p>Let me take an example</p><br>

<strong>Expense Replacement Method Example</strong><br><br>
<p>Ajay is 30 years old and is working in a private company earning a monthly salary of 80,000. His wife is 2 years younger than him i.e., 28 years old and their child is 2 years of age. He is planning to accumulate 25 Lakhs for their child’s higher education after 15 years i.e. when the child is 17 years old. Ajay also has an outstanding home loan of 25 Lakhs. He spends approximately 25,000 per month on his household and lifestyle expenses.</p><br>

<p>For the Expense Replacement method, you can use the following procedure.</p><br>

<p>1. Calculate monthly expenses</p>
<p>2. Age of the younger spouse</p>
<p>3. Life expectancy (take minimum age limit of 85 years)</p><br>
<p>Let us calculate this with the help of the example mentioned above:</p><br>

<p>1. Monthly expenses – Rs. 25,000</p>
<p>2. Age of younger spouse – 28 years</p>
<p>3. Life expectancy – 85 Years</p><br>
<p>Life Insurance cover = (Life Expectancy – age of younger spouse) * 12 months * monthly expenses

<p>(85-28)*12*25000 = Rs. 171,00,000 = Rs. 1.71 Crore</p><br>

<p>This amount of 1.71 crore is the basic cover requirement. We need to now add all outstanding loans and various goals amount to this value.</p><br>

<p>In Ajay’s case, there is an outstanding loan of 25 Lakhs and the amount required for covering child’s higher education is 25 Lakhs. Add this 50 Lakhs to the basic cover of 1.71 crores (as explained above).</p><br>

<p>So, the total Term Insurance cover requirement would come out to be 2.21 Crores.</p><br>

<p>In case Ajay has any assets, that asset value needs to be subtracted from the total cover requirement except in cases where the asset is your self-occupied house.</p><br>

<p>Suppose Ajay had invested in PF, PPF, MF etc., to the tune of 21 Lakhs, this amount must be subtracted from the term cover of 2.1 Crores.</p><br>

<p>The new cover requirement that Ajay will need would be 2 Crores.</p><br>

<p>I’ve assumed returns over inflation as 0% i.e., if inflation is 6%, then the returns would also be 6%.</p><br>

<p>You can use our Term Insurance calculator to check the requirement for the total sum assured.</p><br>

<strong>Which technique should you choose – Income replacement or expense replacement</strong><br><br>
<p>One can choose any option that best suits their requirement, however, please ensure that you purchase a term insurance cover.</p><br>

<p>The income replacement method is simple. All you need is monthly income, current age, retirement age, and then assumptions of increment and returns.</p><br>

<p>The expense replacement method will include much more factors like monthly income, goals, liabilities and assets etc.</p><br>

<strong>Let’s look at another example –</strong><br><br>
<p>Ajay is 25 years old and is earning a salary of 1 Lakh per month. He wants to retire at age 60. What would be the insurance requirement for Ajay? Based on the calculations explained above, Ajay’s insurance cover requirement would be 4.20 Crores in this case. However, the question remains – whether insurance companies will be ready to give him a cover of 4.20 Crores?</p><br>

<p>Generally, most insurance companies follow the thumb rule that I have mentioned in the previous chapter. The maximum amount, which is allowed by insurance companies for Term Insurance cover is 15-20 times of your annual salary. ome companies also extend it to a maximum of 25 times your annual salary. Anything above 25 times become difficult to purchase.</p><br>

<p>Also, this is an overstated requirement of term insurance. If we reduce the retirement age to 40, the term insurance cover requirement will reduce drastically but that may be an understated requirement of term insurance.</p><br>

<p>The income replacement method may provider an overestimated or underestimated value of term insurance but the expense replaced method provides a more accurate estimation of term insurance cover as it includes specific goals for survivors.</p><br>

        question: "Till what age should I purchase term insurance",
        answer: "If you are looking for a one-word answer for an ideal age till when coverage will be needed, the answer would be – 60 years.Then, why are people still keen on purchasing term insurance coverage beyond the age of 60? There are 2 reasons behind this and the reasons are more psychological than financial.",

            `<p>If you have already read my previous articles on Term Insurance modules, you must be already aware about the need for Term Insurance and the amount of coverage you will require. The obvious follow-up question that you would have thought of is – Till what age should I buy a Term Insurance policy? Should it be till age 50/60/70/75/85 or 99 years?</p><br>

<p>If you are looking for a one-word answer for an ideal age till when coverage will be needed, the answer would be – 60 years. This age is considered as normal retirement age for any person working in India.</p><br>


<p>However, if you do plan to work beyond 60, then you can opt for the age where you do plan to retire. This can always be rounded off to the nearest age bracket that you intend to work. For example – Most Doctors continue to practice and treat patients beyond the age of 60. In such cases, they can opt for term insurance coverage till age 65/70.</p><br>

<p>Note: If you can generate the required assets prior to your retirement age, you can terminate your term policy. For example – You had planned your retirement at 60 but you were able to accumulate the required assets by the age of 50. In this case, you can stop your term insurance policy at the age of 50.</p><br>

<p>*Required assets mean the amount of money required to achieve your financial goals including retirement, children\`s education, marriage, house purchase, vacation, etc.</p><br>

<p>There are some exceptional scenarios too where you can buy term insurance cover beyond the age of 60. I will explain these towards the end of this article.</p><br>

<strong>Why are people keen to purchase Term Insurance cover beyond age 60?</strong><br><br>
<p>When we are aware that term insurance is typically required till the age of 60, why are people still keen on purchasing term insurance cover beyond the age of 60? There are 2 reasons behind this and the reasons are more psychological than financial.</p><br>

<p>1. Legacy – Death is certain and everyone one of us will die one day. What is the harm if my children/spouse can benefit from it and get additional money (1 Crore/2 Crores or whatever the cover is) if I die after age 60 as part of my legacy?</p>
<p>2. Returns – Most of us are concerned about returns on our investments. If I do not die till the age of 60, I will not get any amount that I had paid as part of the coverage premium back. What is the harm in paying an additional premium and ensuring that my children/spouse will get term insurance money (1 Crore/2 Crores or whatever the cover is) if I am not going to get anything back in my lifetime?</p><br>
<p>This is the basic underlying psychology of investors when they decide to purchase term insurance coverage beyond the age of 60.</p><br>

<p>It is very difficult to change this psychology of investors and it will take a long time and a lot of effort to bring a change to this mindset. To simplify the process, let me explain the financial side of it i.e. Why does it not make sense from a financial perspective to purchase term insurance coverage beyond 60?</p><br>

<strong>Firstly, let us discuss on why term insurance is only required till the age of 60 and not beyond</strong><br><br>
<p>In India, the retirement age is assumed to be 60 (though this scenario is now changing) and by the age of 60 you will not have dependents.</p><br>

<p><span class="font-semibold">No Dependents</span> – One of the key reasons for buying Term Life Insurance is to secure the financial future of your dependents in case of any unfortunate event of death of the earning member of a family. You may have dependents like your spouse, children, or elderly parents who are financially dependent on you while you are working. However, by the age of 60, this dependency changes, especially with respect to your children based on the assumption that they will be self-sufficient and you don’t need a term insurance policy for their protection. At the same time, you accumulate required assets for your retired life by the age of 60 and you don’t need a term insurance policy for your spouse’s financial protection.</p><br>


<p><span class="font-semibold">Premium</span> – Once you are retired, your children may have to pay the term insurance premium on your behalf, if you have not provisioned this expense in your retirement planning. Thus, continuing the policy beyond 60 is not cost-effective. There are many insurance companies that are giving you the option of paying premiums till the age of 60 and providing coverage till the age of 85. However, this is also not cost-effective.</p><br>


<strong>Legacy and Returns</strong><br><br>
<p>The sudden increase in popularity of term plans that provide coverage till 85-90 years is the result of an aggressive marketing strategy followed by insurance companies and web aggregators.</p><br>

<p>I have started seeing one such advertisement on my Facebook feed for a long time. Here’s how the advertisement goes –</p><br>

<strong>“Leave the legacy for your child. Buy term insurance cover of 1 Crore at just Rs. 2000/- per month for 85 years.”</strong><br><br>
<p>Such advertisements often make you ponder that leaving 1 Crore for your child does not seem to be a bad option, isn’t it?</p><br>

<p>Firstly, let me clarify that this insurance plan isn’t as great as it looks. In fact, with such a plan, there’s no way you’re going to leave a legacy of 1 crore for your child.</p><br>

<p>It is essential to understand the time value of money. The value of 1 Crore in present time will not be same in the future. For example, you can easily buy a flat within 1 Crore in today’s scenario. Nevertheless, the same amount of 1 Crore may not even be enough to purchase a basic car after 40-50 years.</p><br>

<p>Taking today’s trend of inflation into consideration, let’s see what will be the value of 1 Crore after 40-50 years.</p><br>`,
            `<p>Suppose your current age is 30 years and you take a term insurance plan that provides coverage till 80 years for 1 crore. The value of 1 Crore would be 9.7 Lakhs after 40 years i.e. when you are 70 years old and 5.4 Lakhs after 50 years i.e. when your age is 80 considering an average inflation rate of 6%. Do you think this is the kind of legacy you want to leave for your children?</p><br>

<strong>Returns</strong><br><br>
<p>Now that you have understood that such long-term insurance plans will not yield any results in terms of leaving a legacy for your kin, let’s look into another important aspect which is Returns. Here are some calculations to ascertain- Why term insurance plan till 85 years is not beneficial?</p><br>

<p>If you’re 30-year-old and want to buy a sum assured of 1 Crore, there can be 2 options.</p><br>

<p>1. Term Insurance till the age of 60 i.e. your retirement age</p>
<p>2. Term Insurance till the age of 85 years</p><br>
<p>Now let’s compare the premium that you need to pay for both these plans.</p><br>

<p>I am considering an example of ICICI Pru Term Plan which offers coverage for up to 60 and 85 years.</p><br>

<p>1st case: Premium for 30 years i.e. till the age of 60 years (Term – 30 Years) – Rs. 13,392 per year</p><br>


<p>2nd case: Premium for 55 years i.e. till the age of 85 years– Rs. 25,888 per year</p><br>


<p>Total difference in the Premium for these two plans – Rs. 12,496 per year</p><br>

<p>To make it easier to understand, let’s consider 2 distinct scenarios here:</p><br>

<p>1. Death before the age of 60</p>
<p>2. The person survives beyond 60 years</p><br>
<strong>Scenario I – Death Before The Age Of 60</strong><br><br>
<p>If a person buys a term insurance coverage till age of 85 years and if he dies before the age of 60, he will undoubtedly lose some money.</p><br>

<p>Suppose a person dies at the age of 55, he will lose out on the additional premium amount that he’s paid which is 12,496 per year i.e. 3.12 Lakhs in 25 years if he had opted for a term insurance plan that provided coverage till the age of 85 years.</p><br>

<strong>Scenario II – Survival Beyond 60 Years</strong><br><br>
<p>What would happen if a person survives beyond 60 years and invests Rs. 12,496 per year? Will he still gain if he lives till the age of 75/80/85 years?</p><br>

<p>Let’s assume that this person lives till 75 and invests that surplus amount of Rs. 12,496 per year. By the age of 75, this investment value would be around 2.19 Crores if we consider 12% returns.</p><br>

<p>How?- Pls find below the table –</p><br>

            `<br><strong>Special Case</strong><br><br>

<p>There are some special circumstances where you can opt for term insurance cover till the age of 85 years –</p><br>


<p>1. If you have children with special needs and you are not able to accumulate the required corpus for child\`s lifetime needs.</p>
<p>2. If you are a grandparent have dependent grandchildren</p>
<p>3. If you are planning to work beyond the age of 60</p>
<p>4. If you are not able to clear your liabilities till the age of 60</p><br>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>

<p>Do not buy Term Insurance plan till age 85/99/100 years on the grounds that it’ll serve as a legacy for your children, and you will save any premium. We’ve already evaluated and broken down this calculation and seen that that this amount of 1 Crore will become negligible in a span of 40/50 years. Besides, this money can be used only by your nominee alone and you’d never be able to use this money. On the other hand, if you invest the additional amount in mutual funds and survive beyond 60, the money would be in your hands.</p><br>


<strong>Points to remember:</strong><br><br>

<p>1. Purchase term insurance till the age of 60</p>
<p>2. If you are planning to work after the age of 60 or if you have any special circumstance, then you can purchase term insurance till the age of 70/80/90 etc.</p><br>`,

            `<p>My clients usually ask me which is the best term insurance policy. What they mean is which insurance company will ensure 100% claim settlement.</p><br>


<p>The answer is none. Why?</p><br>


<p>No insurance company has a 100% claim settlement ratio and your family can bear the brunt of an unsettled claim by the insurance company.</p><br>


<p>Understand this- if an insurance company has received 50,000 insurance claims and their claim settlement ratio is 99% i.e. 49,500 claims are settled. There would still be 500 claims which would go unsettled and your claim can be one of them which can go unsettled. So, there is no way to ensure that your claim would be settled and that is the reason there is no best-term insurance policy in the market.</p><br>


<p>We often see the news regarding the Claim Settlement Ratio of Insurance Companies. Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the Insurance Regulator will publish the details regarding this in its annual report. While it looks like a technical insurance term, it is in our own interest to know what it means for us.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">What is Claim Settlement Ratio – Meaning?</p><br>
<p>The claim settlement ratio is defined as the number of claims settled by the Insurance Company out of every 100 claims requests received by the company. If an Insurance Company received 100 claims requests in a year and the company settled 80 claims, the Claim Settlement Ratio of the company is 80%.</p><br>


<p>If an Insurance Company received 100 claims requests in a year and the company rejected 20 claims, then the Claim Rejection Ratio of the company is 80%.</p><br>


<p>IRDA divides its Claim Settlement Ratio in 3 parts</p><br>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Settled = Claims Settled/Total No. of Claims Reported* 100</li>
    <li>Rejected = Claims Rejected/Total No. of Claims Reported* 100</li>
    <li>Pending = Claims Pending/Total No. of Claims Reported* 100</li>
</ul><br>
<p>IRDAI Claim settlement ratio  –  IRDA Annual Report</p><br>`,
            `<br><p class="font-bold">IRDA Claim Settlement Ratio – What is included?</p><br>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li>Claim Settlement Ratio is calculated for Death Claims only</li>
<li>Maturity Claims are not included in Claim Settlement Ratio</li>
<li>It includes all products of Life Insurance Company whether it is a Term Plan, Endowment Plan or ULIP</li>
<li>IRDA does not publish Claim Settlement Ratio of Term Insurance separately</li>
</ul><br>
<p class="font-bold">Early Claims and Non-Early Claims</p><br>
<p>Any claims reported in the first 3 years of the policy (from the date of policy issuance) are called Early Claims and insurance companies will be carrying out a detailed investigation to ensure the genuine nature of such claims (unless there is a genuine reason for a claim like death due to an accident). If it is found that the policyholder has deliberately suppressed material facts at the time of taking the policy, such claims will be repudiated. But after the first 3 years, the claims are called Non-early Claims and they cannot be rejected. Why non-early claims can not be rejected, because of Section 45 of the Insurance Act.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938 – Indisputability Clause</p><br>
<p><strong>As per IRDAI-</strong>  No policy of life insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after the expiry of three years from the date of the policy, i.e. from the date of issuance of the policy or the date of commencement of risk or the date of revival of the policy or the date of rider to the policy, whichever is later.</p><br>


<p>That means your claim cannot be rejected by the life insurance company after 3 years of risk commencement, issuance of the policy, or revival of the policy, whichever is later.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Why Claims are rejected?</p><br>
<p>It is up to you to select the Life Insurance Company of your choice. But Claim Settlement Ratio alone should not be the criteria for deciding the company.</p><br>


<p>Let me explain with an example:</p><br>


<p>Mr. X has purchased a Term Policy of Rs. 50 Lakh from a private company. This private company was not having a high Claim Settlement Ratio, as per the IRDA data. Since he is a diabetic, he disclosed his health condition. He has undergone the pre- medical examination arranged by the insurance company and his premium was loaded by around 20% from the normal premium quoted earlier. Unfortunately, he died within 2 years of taking the policy. His nominee got the claim because he had mentioned his health conditions correctly at the time of buying the policy. Had he not mentioned that his nominee would have been denied the claim after a detailed claim investigation by the company.</p><br>


<p>Now, imagine another situation:</p><br>


<p>Mr. X has taken a policy from the company with the highest Claim Settlement Ratio. Here, he has not disclosed his diabetic condition. What will happen, if there is a claim in the first 3 years like above? Will his nominee receive the claim? No, because each claim will be investigated separately and will be decided on the merit of each case.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">What you should do while buying a policy?</p><br>

<p>If you fill up all the correct information while buying the policy, you need not worry about the Claim Settlement Ratio of the company. You have to read each question in the Proposal Form and answer it correctly to the best of your knowledge. There will be questions about your current health conditions, medication, family history of hereditary diseases, previous policies held by you, etc. Habits like smoking and drinking also have to be disclosed. There can be a pre-medical examination depending on the type of policy and its value. The insurance company will decide on each proposal based on the information given by you. If there is an adverse finding, the company will either charge a higher premium or reject the proposal.</p><br>


<p>You should fill the Proposal Form by yourself. Agents can definitely help you in filling the Proposal Form but never allow them to fill it by themselves by just putting your signature on it.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Claim Settlement Ratio – Reason to Worry?</p><br>

<p>If you are honest and disclose all the information while buying the policy, there is no need for you to worry about the “Claim Settlement Ratio” of insurance companies. Normally, all insurance companies will honor the genuine claims.</p><br>


<p>Or, you can approach the appellate forums like Insurance Ombudsman and Consumer Court to get justice.</p><br>

<p>The reason to worry is when you are hiding the material facts about your health, occupation, or your habits like smoking, etc. The chances of claim rejection become high.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Conclusion</p><br>

<p>Claim settlement ratio does not ensure settlement of term insurance claims. It should not be the sole reason for selecting a term insurance policy. Though it can be one of the reasons to select term insurance policy, a high claim settlement ratio may also mean that the company is doing due diligence in selecting their prospects.</p><br>


<p>There are other factors that need to be considered while selecting a term insurance policy, which we will discuss in later articles.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Points to remember:</p><br>

<p>1. Declare all material facts while purchasing a Term Insurance policy.</p>
<p>2. Do not select Term Insurance policy solely on basis of claim settlement ratio.</p><br>`,

            `<p>I assume the majority of you shop online on Flipkart or Amazon. What happens if you buy a phone from one of these e-commerce sites? It displays a number of additional alternatives for add-ons, such as a phone’s back cover, earphones, a screen protector, etc. A similar scenario occurs when you try to buy a term insurance policy; you are offered several add-on options like accidental death cover, accidental disability cover, critical illness cover, waiver of premium, etc. These add-ons are called riders in a term insurance policy.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Sounds simple, doesn\`t it?</p><br>
<p>But it’s not as simple as buying an accessory along with a mobile phone. In a term insurance policy, it is significantly more complicated. So, let’s understand the concept of riders first and then explore the different types of riders available in a term insurance policy.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Accelerated benefit riders and Additional benefit riders</p><br>
<p>Raju made the decision to purchase a term insurance policy of 1 Crore with a critical illness rider of 10 Lakhs, which, let’s assume, is an accelerated benefits rider. After 5 years, Raju was diagnosed with cancer. The insurance company will provide an upfront payment of 10 Lakhs.</p><br>


<p>What happens if Raju is unable to recover from cancer and passes away after 6 months? His family will receive 90 Lakhs, as 10 Lakhs has already been paid by the insurance company.</p><br>


<p>In an accelerated benefit rider, the total benefit under the term insurance remains the same, but the payment is accelerated, meaning the policyholder receives the benefit before death.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Additional benefit riders</p><br>
<p>Now, let’s consider a second scenario. Raju decided to purchase a term insurance policy of 1 Crore with an accidental death benefit rider of 50 Lakhs, which, let’s say, is an additional benefits rider.</p><br>


<p>After 5 years, Raju died in an accident. His family will receive 150 Lakhs, which includes the 100 Lakhs term insurance cover and the 50 Lakhs accidental death benefit cover.</p><br>


<p>However, if the death is due to natural causes and not an accident, his family will receive only 1 Crore.</p><br>


<p>I hope the concept is clear. Let’s move on to the type of riders in a term insurance policy.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Types of Riders</p><br>
<p class="font-semibold">Accidental Death Benefit Rider</p><br>
<p>The accidental death benefit rider is typically an additional benefit rider in most term insurance policies. With this rider, if the policyholder dies in an accident, the family receives an extra sum assured in addition to the sum assured provided by the base life term insurance policy, as illustrated in the previous example (related to the concept of the additional benefit rider).</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Should you purchase it?</p><br>
<p>No, it is advisable to avoid it. Personal accidental cover is intended to provide protection against Permanent Total Disability (PTD), Permanent Partial Disability (PPD), and Total Temporary Disability (TTD), rather than offering a death benefit. If you require additional coverage, it would be more beneficial to opt for higher-term insurance coverage instead of purchasing an accidental death benefit rider.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Accidental Disability Rider</p><br>
<p>An accidental disability rider can be an accelerated or additional benefit rider in term insurance policies. Ideally, it should be an additional benefit rider.</p><br>


<p>Under this rider, a specified sum assured is paid out in the event of disability resulting from an accident. The sum assured can be provided as a lump sum amount or as a monthly income for a predetermined period, such as 5 or 10 years, depending on the benefit structure outlined in the policy.</p><br>


<p>Let’s consider an example: Suresh is traveling from Mumbai to Pune when he is involved in an accident that leaves him disabled and unable to work in the future. Along with his term insurance policy, Suresh had obtained an accidental disability rider of 50 Lakhs. He may receive this amount either as a lump sum or as a monthly income over the next 5 or 10 years, depending on the chosen benefit mode.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Should you purchase it?</p><br>
<p>Avoid purchasing the accidental disability cover as a rider. However, it is advisable to purchase it as a separate policy from a general insurance company. Personal Accidental cover is purchased to provide coverage for Permanent Total Disability (PTD), Permanent Partial Disability (PPD), and Total Temporary Disability (TTD).</p><br>


<p>The reason for avoiding it as a rider is that the accidental disability rider in term insurance typically covers only Permanent Total Disability (PTD). Permanent Partial Disability (PPD) and Total Temporary Disability (TTD) are normally not covered. Additionally, the definition of accidental disability is not standardized among riders in term insurance policies.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Critical Illness Cover</p><br>
<p>Critical illness cover offers a lump sum amount to the policyholder upon being diagnosed with one of the critical illnesses specified in the policy. The payout is contingent upon the illness reaching a certain level of severity and the policyholder surviving for a specified duration.</p><br>


<p>For example, if an individual holds a critical illness rider of 20 Lakhs and is diagnosed with stage 1 cancer, the amount will not be disbursed as the illness does not meet the required severity. However, if the individual is diagnosed with stage 2 or 3 cancer, a lump sum of 20 Lakhs will be provided (this is just an example to show the payout on severity).</p><br>


<p>Most critical illness riders include a survival period clause, mandating that the policyholder must survive for 30 days in order to be eligible for the payout.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Should you purchase it?</p><br>
<p>Yes, you may purchase critical illness cover as a rider.</p><br>


<p>Opting for it as a rider is advantageous because it typically covers a broader range of critical illnesses compared to a standalone critical illness policy, and the premium remains fixed while it increases with age in standalone policies from general insurers.</p><br>


<p>However, it’s crucial to note that term insurance is typically recommended till age 60, while critical illness coverage is necessary throughout one’s lifetime.</p><br>


<p>Ideally, the critical illness cover should be an additional benefit rider.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Terminal Illness Rider</p><br>
<p>The terminal illness rider provides the policyholder with the entire sum assured specified in the term insurance policy if they are diagnosed with a terminal illness. For instance, if Raju has a term insurance cover of 1 Crore with a terminal illness rider, and after 5 years he is diagnosed with a terminal illness with a life expectancy of fewer than 6 months, the insurance company will disburse the entire amount of 1 Crore upon submission of a certificate from a medical practitioner.</p><br>


<p>The terminal illness rider is an accelerated benefit in all term insurance policies.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Should you purchase it?</p><br>
<p>Yes, you should purchase the terminal illness rider.</p><br>


<p>Nowadays, it is more commonly included as a feature in term insurance policies rather than being offered as a separate rider.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Waiver of Premium on Disability/Critical Illness Rider:</p><br>
<p>The waiver of premium on disability/critical illness rider exempts the policyholder from paying future premiums in the event of disability or critical illness.</p><br>


<p>For example, if Raju holds a term insurance cover of 1 Crore for a term of 20 years with this rider, and after 9 months he becomes disabled due to an accident, the future premiums will be waived off while the policy remains in force. In other words, Raju will not be required to pay the premium for the next 19 years. This rider can be advantageous in situations where paying the premium becomes challenging due to disability or critical illness.</p><br>


<p class="font-semibold">Should you purchase it?</p><br>
<p>Yes, you can consider purchasing this rider as it can relieve the financial burden of paying premiums in the event of disability or critical illness.</p><br>


<p>This rider is also available in certain children’s life insurance policies in case of the policyholder’s death.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Conclusion</p><br>
Ideally, a pure vanilla term insurance policy without any riders is sufficient. However, some term insurance policies come with built-in riders. If you have a specific need, it is recommended to opt for a rider that addresses that particular need, rather than purchasing all available riders. In some cases, purchasing a standalone policy from a general insurance company may be a better option than adding rider to a term insurance policy.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Points to Remember:</p><br>
<p>1. It is generally not necessary to buy riders in a term insurance policy. A pure vanilla term insurance cover is often the most suitable choice.</p>
<p>2. If you have a specific need, consider selecting a specific rider that addresses that need, rather than purchasing all available riders.</p>
<p>3. Purchasing a standalone policy from a general insurance company might be a more favourable option than adding rider to a term insurance policy.</p><br>

            `<p>Recently, my investment advisor recommended that I buy a term insurance cover of 2 Crores with a regular premium payment option spanning 25 years. I am currently 35 years old and need insurance coverage until I reach the age of 60.</p><br>


<p>While exploring the online purchase of term insurance, I discovered different premium payment term options, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years and regular premium till age 60 i.e. 25 years.</p><br>


<p>To make an informed decision, I decided to calculate the premium amounts for a 2 Crores term insurance policy.</p><br>


<p>For a regular premium payment over 25 years, the annual cost would be Rs. 33,718.</p><br>


<p>Alternatively, for a limited premium payment term of 5 years, the yearly premium would amount to Rs. 1,20,916.</p><br>


<p>The limited premium payment terms of 7 years and 10 years would require annual payments of Rs. 95,872 and Rs. 63,411, respectively.</p><br>


<p>Considering these figures, if I choose the 5-year limited premium payment term, the total amount paid in premiums would be Rs. 6,04,580. Similarly, for the 7-year term, the total premium amount would be Rs. 6,71,104, and for the 10-year term, it would be Rs. 6,34,110. On the other hand, paying premiums for 25 years would result in a total payment of Rs. 8,42,950.</p><br>


<p>Given the lower premiums and the freedom from paying premiums for the next 25 years, the question is why my investment advisor is recommending the regular premium payment option. Although I plan to address this concern with my advisor directly, I wanted to gather some feedback beforehand.</p><br>


<p>Sounds Familiar!</p><br>


<p>This situation seems to be confusing, as approximately 60% of my clients have raised similar questions. So, I decided to write an article on this topic to provide clarity on the topic.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">What is limited premium payment in term insurance?</p><br>
<p>Suppose you purchase a term insurance policy for a duration of 25 years. However, you are only required to pay the premium for a period of 10 years. Even though you stop paying the premium after 10 years, the insurance coverage continues for the entire 25-year term. This means you won’t have to make any further premium payments for the remaining 15 years, yet you’ll still enjoy the protection offered by the policy.</p><br>


<p>Now, let’s explore two potential scenarios if you are planning to choose a limited premium payment term option.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Death before limited premium payment term</p><br>
<p>Let’s consider a scenario where Ajay has purchased a term insurance cover of 2 Crores with a limited premium payment option of 5 years and a term of 25 years, as mentioned in the previous example. The annual premium amount for this plan would be Rs. 1,20,916.</p><br>


<p>Now, let’s imagine a situation where Ajay, unfortunately, passes away after 4 years. In this case, he would have paid a total of Rs. 4,83,664 in premiums. However, if he had opted for the regular premium payment option, he would have paid Rs. 1,34,872 in premiums over the same period. This results in a loss of Rs. 3,48,792 when compared to the regular premium payment option.</p><br>


<p>Similarly, if Ajay had chosen the premium payment term of 7 years, the loss would have been Rs. 2,48,616 in 4 years, and for the premium payment term of 10 years, the loss would have amounted to Rs. 1,82,183 in the same period.</p><br>


<p>These calculations assume that Ajay did not invest the differential amount anywhere. However, the potential savings would have been higher if he had invested that money in other instruments and earned returns from those investments.</p><br>


<p>This brings us to the second scenario, where we explore the additional amount Ajay could have saved if he had invested the differential amount and lived beyond the limited premium payment term.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Survival after limited premium payment term</p><br>
<p>Let’s take a look at the premium payment options for a term insurance policy:</p><br>


<p>If you choose to pay for 5 years, the total premium amount paid would be Rs. 6,04,580. On the other hand, if you pay for 25 years, the total premium amount paid would be Rs. 8,42,950. This indicates a difference of Rs. 2,38,370, which seems like a discount provided by the insurance company.</p><br>


<p>However, let’s dig deeper and determine if this is truly a discount or if it would be more beneficial to pay the regular premium and invest the differential amount. To evaluate this, I have prepared a table considering return assumptions of 8%, 10%, and 12%.</p><br>`,
            `<br><p>Upon analyzing the table, it becomes obvious that opting for the regular premium payment term consistently results in positive cash flow at the end of the tenure. This principle also applies when purchasing a policy until age 85 and paying the premium until age 60, or for 10, 15, or 20 years.</p><br>


<p>There is an exception to this rule for individuals with irregular cash flow, such as businessmen uncertain about their ability to pay premiums for the next 20-30 years. In such cases, it may be more prudent to opt for the limited premium payment term. The same can be true for individuals in risky professions who may wish to retire early but do not want to pay a premium after their retirement.</p><br>


<p class="font-bold">Points to remember:</p><br>
<p>In most cases, it is not advisable to opt for the limited premium payment option. It is generally more advantageous to choose the regular premium payment term.</p><br>`,
